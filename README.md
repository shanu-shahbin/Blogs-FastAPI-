The FastAPI Blog API is a RESTful web service built using FastAPI, allowing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. It provides endpoints for managing blog posts with authentication using JWT tokens and OAuth2. The API also integrates Swagger UI and ReDoc for interactive API documentation.
